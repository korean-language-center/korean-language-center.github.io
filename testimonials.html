<p>I have learned a great deal I didn't know at the Korean Language Center of New York and an even greater amount I thought I did know. As a second generation Korean American I thought I had a grasp of the basics and fundamentals of Korean. Much to my surprise I found I was sorely lacking even though I had attended Korean school as a teenager and taken classes in college.

<p>The teaching staff at the Korean Language Center of New York has patiently worked with me.  Their teaching techniques and focus on practice and repetition has allowed me to learn a great deal and to correct misconceptions or misunderstandings I had of the Korean language. I highly encourage anyone interested in learning Korean or improving their Korean to enroll.

    <p>I had taken Korean for several years when I first moved to New York, and had studied under several teachers. But my experience here has been perhaps the best that I have had. Most importantly, the classes at the Korean Language Center are nice and cozy, giving everyone a chance to interact on-one-one with the instructor and to have any oft-repeated mistakes ironed out. For someone who isn't a native Korean or Korean-American, this is especially important. 
    <p>I also appreciate the emphasis on sentence drills, which has given me more facility with the spoken language. The pacing of the class is also just right -- on the one hand, it's really difficult to learn a language if you're only taking classes once a week; on the other hand, the load isn't overwhelming. Lastly and most importantly, learning Korean here is a really good time. Picking up a new language isn't easy, but having it be a lot of fun helps a lot.

    <p>I decided to start learning Korean after dating my girlfriend for several years and wanting to someday explore the country and meet her family. I initially was enrolled in Korean class at a big university in New York, but after that class was canceled I began to search for more specialized schools just for Korean. I am really happy I found the Korean Language Center (KLC) because the level of instruction and the small class sizes really help in learning this difficult language. The professors make learning Korean very approachable and not only guage but the culture and customs as well. They really care about the students progress and personalize instruction for the students in each class. After taking classes for a little over a year at the Korean Language Center, I can now read, write, and even converse in Korean. Learning Korean at KLC has really been a fun experience!

<p>I have had a lifelong interest in Asian languages and cultures.  When I decided to study Korean in early 2012, I bought materials and attempted to do it on my own.  I didn’t get very far, so I searched for a place where I could attend Korean language classes geared specifically to adults.  I found nothing suitable on Long Island, where I live. 

<p>When I discovered the <strong>Korean Language Center</strong> in New York City, during an Internet search, I wondered whether the lengthy rail commute would be worth the effort and expense.


<p>The answer, unequivocally, is YES!  I have learned so much during my first four months of classes that I cannot believe it.  I can read and write Korean, speak, understand, and translate from English to Korean and vice-versa already.  Classes are small, and each of us gets plenty of attention.  Questions are invited and answered in great detail.  I leave class every week with a full understanding of the material and work hard to learn what is necessary to be comfortable in the following week’s class.  I find my teacher, Dr. Kim, to be demanding –which is exactly what I want and need in an instructor in order to maximize my learning.  The Korean Language Center of New York was the very best choice I could have possibly made.  My current working vocabulary is in excess of 500 words, including a considerable amount of infinitives; and I have the ability to successfully use this knowledge with three verb tenses.  I will not stop my pursuit of Korean language fluency until I have achieved my objective.  At that point, a celebratory trip to South Korea is on my agenda.  In the meantime, I love going to “Korean School” every Saturday!

<p>I decided to take classes at the KLC to improve my reading and writing skills. I couldn’t believe how quickly my penmanship and reading abilities improved. After one term at KLC, I was at a writing level where I could email my father in Korean! In addition, knowing how to spell the words I had been speaking also heightened my speaking skills. I highly recommend this course to Korean-Americans who want to improve their Korean communication skills!

<p>The KLC is without a doubt the best place to learn Korean in New York. After a little more than a year studying I am able to talk to my in laws in their native language. I am not fluent yet but I am getting closer every day. The professors are excellent and always willing to answer your questions. We not only learn Korean language but also about the culture and traditions of Korea. The materials are unique and comprehensive. I also appreciate the very small class sizes and personalized Attention. Last but not least, the classes are fun!

<p>Before our wedding and in advance of Sang's trip to visit his grandmother we both decided to enroll in the Korean Language Center. Like many Korean-Americans, Sang was frustrated by the language barrier between himself and his parents. His family had immigrated to the States in the 80's, and English was not a first language for either parent. While Sang sought to improve his Korean at least to the point where he could converse comfortably with his family, Felice hoped to someday communicate with her future Korean parents-in-law in their native tongue and better appreciate their culture.

<p>In the midst of our demanding schedules we found that the time spent at the KLC was incredibly rewarding and ultimately made our lives richer with our parents, other Koreans and each other. To our friends who want to learn Korean but say they are too busy, we tell them that if you take a genuine interest you'll find the time! We, for example, kept up with our classes in the midst of our engagement, wedding planning, two full time jobs and regular travel.
It wasn't easy but the effort and time spent have really been worth it! Not only does the school offer a solid and engaging teaching method but the class sizes are very small and improvements are noticeable within months if not weeks.

<p>After a full year of studying with Drs. Lee and Kim we are much closer to our goal. Sang is much more confident in his speaking, and although Felice still has a lot to learn, she went from having no Korean language background whatsoever to being able to read and write and speak an early beginner's level of Korean. Felice has really enjoyed acquiring a new
language and the more she learns the more the veil over this once mysterious language is slowly lifted.

<p>Aside from the skills we've acquired, we're grateful for the encouragement and mentoring our teachers have freely offered us in our efforts to better understand the the Korean culture.
