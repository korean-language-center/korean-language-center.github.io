          <h2>Why study at KLC?</h2>
          <p>Top Ten Reasons Why You Should Study At "The Korean Language Center of New York"</p>

<h4>1. The instructors here are actual qualified educators. </h4>
<p>They are dedicated to teaching second-generation Korean and other Americans to speak Korean fluently and learn about the Korean Culture.</p>
<h4>2. The professors at KLC are always available</h4>
<p>They are eager to give you and extra hand before or after class.
<h4>3. The curriculum resembles the world-renowned Yonsei University teaching method</h4>
<p>The courses are organized into convenient eight week sessions.
<h4>4. Class size is always kept low.  </h4>
<p>Eight students maximum, but typically no more than three or four.
<h4>5. The course content "weaves" a variety of subject matters together in a very interesting and efficient manner.  </h4>
<p>It's not the typical grammar, vocabulary, and spelling drills associated with language classes.  The instructors achieve this weaving process by:
<ul>
   <li>A continuing series of short stories, dialogues, and essays that introduce new grammar and vocabulary and increase in length and difficulty as your ability increases.
  <li>      Pattern drills that are directly related to the short stories and dialogues.  They reinforce the new grammar and vocabularies you just learned in the short stories and dialogues.
  <li>      Korean proverbs provide you an insight into Korean culture, an understanding of the Korean mindset, and sound of a native Korean speaker.
</ul>
<h4>6. When you attain a certain ability level, you will begin to learn Chinese characters</h4>
<p>Including how they are used as the building blocks for many Korean words, and Chinese proverbs.  This is a must for those who want a solid grasp of the Korean language.
<h4>7. The professors have an extensive selection of Korean teaching materials, books maps, poems, and songs that they will use throughout the course</h4>
<p>These will not only give you an insight into the Korean culture, but will also integrate the various parts of the coursework together.
<h4>8. The tuition fee is less expensive that most other schools</h4>
<p>When you look at what you get for your dollar, it's a bargain.
<h4>9. The Korean Language Center of New York is conveniently located in the heart of the Korean community at 38 W 32nd St, 11th floor.</h4>
<p>This location is convenient to all forms of transportation and is just doors away from Korean bookstores, video stores music stores, and the rest of the Korean community.
<h4>10. It's a lot of fun.</h4>
<p>You will have a good time while you learn a foreign language and become familiar with an interesting culture.  What could be better than that?
